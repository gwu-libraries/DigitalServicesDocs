# Supporting Born-Digital Special Collections

The Digital Services unit supports the accessioning and transfer of digital records into the collections of GWLAI. This work is focused on addressing the backlog of digital media found in GW LAI’s Specialized Collections and supporting the accessioning of new digital media and born-digital content. 

This work relates to workflows and tools that are necessary for ensuring the proper stewardship of digital records and is therefore closely related to the unit’s digital stewardship work.
