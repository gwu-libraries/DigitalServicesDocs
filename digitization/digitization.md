# Digitization and Reformatting
This section relates to digitization of specialized collections material for the development of digital collections. It does not pertain to reproductions (digitization-on-demand) for users.

For more information on the selection of collection material for digitization, see the ["Developing Digital Collections"](/digitalcollections.md) section.

## Digitization Overview 

### Audio and Moving Image Transfers
The Digital Services Unit supports access to audiovisual material. **However, we are unable to perform any preservation actions on carriers. Therefore, the digital services unit is only able to transfer media carriers that are in good condition.**

|       | Format          | Equipment used   | Notes          |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Audio | Compact Cassette | Tascam 202mkvii |                   |  
| Audio | Phonograph record (grooved media) | Audio-Technica AT-PL120 | |
| Moving Image | VHS | JVC HR-S9900U | |
| Moving Image | U-matic SP | Sony BVU 950 | Small and fullsize |
| Moving Image | Betacam SP | Sony UVW-1800 | This does not include digibeta or betamax formats!|

All other formats may not be transferred in-house and must be sent to a digitization vendor.

### Imaging 

|       | Format          | Equipment used   | Notes          |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Text | Bound and unbound textual documents | Overhead Scanner OS 12000 (Zeutschel) |                   |  
| Graphic | Prints | OS 12000 or Epson 10000XL | |
| Graphic | Film (negatives/transparencies) | Epson 1000XL | |

Limited capacity to image oversized documents (anything over 34 x 24 inches); may require out-side vendor for some over-sized documents.
