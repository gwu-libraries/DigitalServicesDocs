# Audio and Video Reproduction

Audio cassette tapes, video tapes, CDs, DVDs, and other audio-visual formats must be digitally reproduced to facilitate research access. We do not permit researchers to listen or view any electronic media in its original form.

## Reproduction of Material Via Vendor
Special Collections is not able to digitize all a/v formats. For any requests where Special Collections' on-site equipment cannot handle materials, we may be able to send those materials to a vendor to digitize. Material in poor condition that requires conservation or specialized expertise and or equipment may also be sent to vendors.

Also, large requests or requests that cannot be filled in a reasonable period of time with available staff time may also be sent to vendors.
