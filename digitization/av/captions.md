# Creating Captions and Transcripts for Audiovisual material
Captions and transcripts for audiovisual material make collections material more accessible and enhance the over-all level of access. Captions should be created as VTT (WEBVTT) format. Captions can be embedded into the content, but only for access files.

## Tools for Creating and Reviewing Captions

## Adobe Premiere
The SCRC digitization lab provides access to Adobe Premiere. You may also request a license for your individual workstation via GWU IT.
