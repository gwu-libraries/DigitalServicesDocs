When digitizing audiovisual carriers, we should update finding aids to reflect new information gained from the digitization process. Use the following fields in ArchivesSpace to hold new information.

## Scope and Contents
Any content notes derived during the digitization process. If we are doing a monitored transfer, we should record notes about the aboutness of the recording.

Examples:
"David Eisenhower gives speech and takes questions from the audience at the alumni association dinner in 1987."
"1991 Convocation honoring Ronald and Nancy Reagan 10 years after Ronald Reagan was shot and brought to GW hospital for treatment."

## Physical Description 
Use a physical description note to hold information about the carrier, length of recording, and other format information (color, sound). You can also use this field to note any issues with the recording or transfer.

Examples:
"1 u-matic tape. 00:25:59. Audio distortion during playback."
