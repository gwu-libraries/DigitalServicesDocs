# Metadata for Web Archives

Metadata for web archives exists in two primary places: within Archive-It, the system used by GWLAI to collect and manage its web archives collection, and within ArchivesSpace, the system that GWLAI uses to describe its archives collections.

Archive-It uses 15 Dublin Core elements. Additional custom metadata fields may also be applied. These metadata fields may be applied to any level of a web archive: collection, seed, and document. SCRC primarily applies metadata to the collection and seed level. See the [Add, edit, and manage your metadata article](https://support.archive-it.org/hc/en-us/articles/208332603-Add-edit-and-manage-your-metadata) in the Archive-It Help Center for more information about metadata and Archive-It

This page synthesizes local application recommendations based upon the *Descriptive Metadata for Web Archiving: Recommendations of the OCLC Research Library Partnership Web Archiving Metadata Working Group.* [^1]

This metadata profile is primarily designed for individual seeds within web archive collections, rather than entire collections of web archive content. While it shares similarities with metadata used in finding aids/EAD, it focuses specifically on metadata creation for individual seeds.

Metadata should be applied to seeds in Archive-It when they are created. It is *strongly encouraged* that all new seeds receive all *required* fields from this profile.
